SMSRoulette app that uses Twilio to connect random
users anonymously.

In short, SMSRoulette is ChatRoulette for SMS.  This
is just a tutorial to make people familiar with Twilio.

Requires:

  redis-py: https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py
  twilio.py: https://github.com/twilio/twilio-python
  flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/
  a few mobile phone users

Don't forget to update your ACCOUNT_SID, ACCOUNT_TOKEN
and CALLER_ID fields in sms.py.  These values can be
obtained from your Twilio account's dashboard.

How to run the app
------------------

1. Register for a free Twilio account.

2. Checkout the code:

   $ git clone git://github.com/jvimal/SMSRoulette.git
   $ cd SMSRoulette
   $ vi sms.py # change this file

3. Download and install redis and the python helper module.

   http://redis.io
   (or) $ apt-get install redis-server
   (or) $ brew install redis

   and:
   $ easy_install redis

4. Download and install Flask webapp microframework

   $ easy_install Flask

5. Install twilio's python library.

   $ easy_install twilio

6. Make sure your computer can accept connections from
   Twilio's servers.  If you're behind a firewall/NAT,
   you might have to use port forwarding.

   $ python app.py

   This will run the webapp locally and will listen on
   port 5000 by default.  Enter the address to reach this
   webserver on Twilio's dashboard.  For me, just entering

    http://<your ip>:5000/sms

   and specifying that the request be of type GET, was
   sufficient.

7. Start using the app!
